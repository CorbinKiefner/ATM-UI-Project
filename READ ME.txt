Important notes about the program:

1.) The program is meant to simulate the screen of an ATM. There is obviously no real cash transactions, however the goal of this project
	was to explore the visual coding workflow and see if I could make an ATM UI on my own.

2.) when testing the login, the correct credentials are as follows:
	Card: 1111-2222-3333-4444
	Pin: 1234

3.) the program has some hidden developer features that will hopefully make navigating this project a bit easier for you. 
	Obviously if this was a real ATM Software that was being released to the public i would take these features out,
	but since its just a personal project i decided to leave them in for you.

	First, if you click ZZZ Bank logo on the log in screen it will bypass the log in so you dont have to enter the card and pin numbers every time.
	Second, there is a button on the log in screen that will reset the database to its default values for easier testing.
	Third, you can check how much you have left of your daily limit to spend under the check balance menu.

	Hopefully this makes your testing process a bit simpler.

4.) The daily limit is only set up for depositing and withdrawing, as those are the only two functions that 
	would theoretically actually move money from within the machine in real life.
